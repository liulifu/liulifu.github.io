# Building a Modern Automated IT Operations System in 2024

In recent years, automation in IT operations has undergone significant changes, especially with the rise of cloud computing, big data, and AI. IT departments are moving beyond traditional support roles, focusing instead on innovation that aligns with business needs. At the heart of this shift is the creation of automated IT operations systems, which are crucial for managing complex environments and supporting rapid business growth.

Unlike traditional "automation," today’s approach is more akin to "Jidoka," a concept from Japanese that emphasizes combining human intelligence with automation. It's not just about making machines run by themselves, but making them smart enough to identify issues and respond automatically. In this model, human expertise remains vital, especially for addressing complex, non-standard scenarios that arise in IT environments.

Building an effective automated IT operations system involves several key components: automation platforms for managing changes, monitoring systems, CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases), and a strong management framework. The automation platform is the backbone, handling system and application updates with the flexibility to adapt to diverse needs. For large enterprises, relying solely on open-source solutions like Ansible or SaltStack often falls short, leading many to develop custom tools that better integrate with their existing infrastructure and meet security requirements.

Monitoring platforms are equally important—they serve as the "eyes" of the automation system, providing real-time feedback on the system's health and performance. In 2024, such platforms are designed not to work in isolation but to integrate seamlessly with other tools through APIs. This allows for a unified view of system status and helps guide automated decision-making, making it easier to identify and resolve issues before they become critical.

Data management, too, plays a vital role. CMDBs form the foundation, holding key information about servers, applications, and configurations. Despite the challenges of keeping data accurate and up-to-date, CMDBs are indispensable in automation workflows. Many companies now adopt a "federated" data approach, allowing different systems to pull from and update the CMDB, ensuring that data remains fresh and relevant across the organization.

The management framework ties everything together, ensuring the system runs smoothly. While many companies use ITIL-based processes, these can be too rigid for the fast pace of modern IT. Today’s management systems prioritize flexibility, allowing for faster decision-making while maintaining essential controls. For instance, by reviewing change content at the planning stage, rather than during execution, companies can reduce delays and focus on what truly matters—speed and reliability.

AI has also found a solid place in the automation space. It allows systems to learn from past data, making predictive analysis and proactive troubleshooting possible. AIOps platforms, which use AI to manage IT operations, are becoming more common. These platforms can use historical data to suggest or even automatically apply fixes for recurring issues, greatly reducing the need for manual intervention. This approach is especially useful for large enterprises, where speed and accuracy in addressing problems are crucial.

The rise of DevOps is tightly connected to these advancements in automation. DevOps emphasizes breaking down the barriers between development and operations teams, relying heavily on automation to enable smoother workflows. In 2024, more companies are adopting DevOps not just to streamline their processes but also to respond more quickly to market changes. By integrating development and operations through automation, businesses can launch new features faster while maintaining a high standard of reliability.

Even with all this automation, the role of IT experts remains important. While many repetitive tasks are now automated, the design and refinement of these systems require human insight. IT professionals today are less about hands-on fixes and more about strategic oversight, using data to guide improvements. This collaborative approach between humans and machines ensures that automation supports business goals effectively, adapting quickly to new challenges.

Ultimately, creating a successful automated IT operations system in 2024 means balancing technology, processes, and people. It’s about understanding the unique needs of the business, choosing the right tools, and ensuring that every aspect—from data to decision-making—works together seamlessly. This way, companies can fully leverage the potential of automation, keeping pace with the rapid evolution of technology and staying competitive in the market.
