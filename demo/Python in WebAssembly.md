### **PyScript and the Rise of Python in WebAssembly: Why Should You Care?**

Ever wanted to run **Python** code directly in a web browser without the need for a backend server? Maybe you’ve always dreamed of building a web app entirely in Python, without touching a single line of JavaScript. Well, buckle up, because **PyScript** is here to make that dream a reality, and it’s built on some seriously cool tech: **WebAssembly (Wasm)**. Let’s dive into what PyScript is, how WebAssembly is changing the game, and what Python has to do with all of it.

### **What Exactly is PyScript?**

In short, **PyScript** is like your favorite dessert—it combines the rich power of Python with the accessibility of web browsers, all while making it ridiculously simple to work with. It allows you to write Python code directly inside HTML files (yes, like JavaScript) and run it in your browser. How? Through the magic of **WebAssembly**.

**PyScript** is built on top of **Pyodide**, a Python runtime compiled to WebAssembly, which allows Python code to execute efficiently in the browser environment. This essentially means you can write Python code in your webpage without setting up a backend server or worrying about complex JavaScript setups.

### **What the Heck is WebAssembly (Wasm)?**

If you haven’t heard of **WebAssembly (Wasm)**, don’t worry, you’re about to. WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary-code format, and it's designed to be fast. Think of it as the assembly language of the web, except that it runs close to **native speed**. It was created to give web applications the performance they need to rival native desktop apps, but all within the browser. In other words, it's the superhero cape that JavaScript always wished it had.

Here’s the kicker: WebAssembly is **language-agnostic**. This means developers can now compile code written in languages like **C**, **C++**, **Rust**, and even **Python** to WebAssembly, and run it in any modern browser with blazing speed. That’s right—Python, which was once mostly confined to data science notebooks and backend servers, is now making its way into the browser through WebAssembly.

### **Python Meets WebAssembly: A New Era**

Python has long been praised for its simplicity and readability, but one criticism it often faced was performance—especially in the browser. Historically, web development has been dominated by JavaScript. But with WebAssembly, the tides are turning.

Thanks to **Pyodide** (which is what powers PyScript under the hood), Python code can be compiled into WebAssembly and run directly in the browser. This not only opens up new opportunities for Python developers but also allows them to do things in the browser that they never could before.

**Python in the browser**—without needing to install anything! No more backend servers, no more compiling JavaScript; you can now run Python natively in the browser, handling logic, UI, and even fancy stuff like machine learning. Python's expanding role in the **Wasm** ecosystem is not just exciting; it's game-changing for web development.

### **Why Should You Care About WebAssembly (and PyScript)?**

Imagine you could build an interactive web app using only Python, avoiding the dreaded JavaScript ecosystem. That’s what WebAssembly and PyScript are making possible. Here’s why this matters:

1. **Faster Performance**: WebAssembly runs at near-native speed. For Python, which has often been considered slower compared to compiled languages, WebAssembly gives it a massive performance boost.
2. **Cross-language Capabilities**: With WebAssembly, developers aren’t confined to JavaScript anymore. You can write parts of your web app in Python (for the logic you love) and leave the rest to JavaScript for DOM manipulation or interactivity.
3. **Bigger Toolset**: You get access to Python’s vast library ecosystem (think **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and even **matplotlib**) in the browser, allowing you to build data-driven applications or even interactive dashboards entirely on the client side.
4. **No Backend Needed**: Since the code runs directly in the browser, you can skip the server entirely for many types of applications. The possibilities for lightweight, high-performance Python web apps are endless.

### **The Current State of Python in WebAssembly**

The Python community is catching up fast to the WebAssembly craze. Projects like **Pyodide** (which PyScript is based on) have already made huge strides, allowing Python to be compiled to WebAssembly. This means developers can run Python code in browsers alongside JavaScript, all while taking advantage of Python's simplicity and power.

**Future Directions**:

- Python's **CPython** runtime itself is being adapted to work with WebAssembly. This will make it even easier for Python developers to write performant web applications that run natively in the browser.
- As WebAssembly matures, we can expect deeper integration of Python with browser APIs, meaning that Python could soon be used for more than just scripting logic, potentially handling full-fledged web apps.

### **Demo Time: A Simple Project Using PyScript**

Enough talk. Let’s jump into a demo! Below is a simple project showcasing how PyScript works, where we’ve restructured a **VAT calculator** using Python, all running in the browser.

#### **HTML + PyScript VAT Calculator**

Here’s the `index.html` structure for our **VAT Calculator**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>PyScript VAT Calculator</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>VAT Calculator</h1>
    <label for="price">Enter Price:</label>
    <input type="number" id="price" placeholder="Enter price" />
    <label for="rate">VAT Rate (%):</label>
    <input type="number" id="rate" placeholder="Enter VAT rate" />
    <button pys-onClick="vat_calculator.calculate_vat">Calculate VAT</button>

    <div id="result"></div>

    <py-script>
      from js import document class VATCalculator: def calculate_vat(self,
      event=None): price_input = document.getElementById("price").value
      rate_input = document.getElementById("rate").value price =
      float(price_input) rate = float(rate_input) vat = price * (rate / 100)
      total = price + vat document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = f"VAT:
      {vat:.2f}, Total: {total:.2f}" vat_calculator = VATCalculator()
    </py-script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### **Project Overview**:

1. **Input**: Users input the price and VAT rate directly into the HTML input fields.
2. **Logic**: The `VATCalculator` class in Python computes the VAT and total price, and displays it on the page using `document.getElementById()` to manipulate the DOM (just like JavaScript would do, but cooler because it’s Python).
3. **Result**: The result is rendered directly in the browser, all without a backend server!

### **Conclusion**

**PyScript**, powered by **WebAssembly**, is helping bridge the gap between Python and the browser, giving us the ability to run Python code natively in web applications. It’s still early days, but the potential is massive. Whether you’re building small web apps, creating interactive data visualizations, or just having fun with Python in the browser, PyScript opens up exciting possibilities.

So, why not give it a spin? Next time someone asks if you can build a web app in Python, you can proudly say, “Yes, and I didn’t even touch JavaScript!”
